Don't believe in whiteboard/proctored and timed coding tests.
While it is informational to see how a puzzle is solved, the standard scoring, timed, "closed book" sessions are irritating and misleading when judging one's potential as a software developer.
Software development is not an individual olympic sport (not a spectator sport either.
With that said it is also a reality: gatekeeper obstacle, threshold to pass, and the more you practice the better your chances not to fail under pressure.
